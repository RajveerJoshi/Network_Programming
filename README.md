# TCP-IP Network_Programming
TCP/IP network programming refers to the process of developing applications that utilize the TCP/IP protocol suite to communicate over a network. These applications can be client-server based, peer-to-peer, or any other networked architecture. Network programming allows developers to create software that can send and receive data over the internet or any TCP/IP-based network.

# Features
1) Reliability.
2) Connection-Oriented Communication.
3) Ordered Data Delivery.
4) Flow Control.
5) Cross-Platform Compatibility.
6) Security.

# Programming_Concept_Of_Network_programming
A) Server-Side-------------
1) Create a socket.
2) Bind it to an IP+PortNumber.
3) Wait for request Arrive.
4) Extract (read) data that arrived in request.
5) Process data.
6) Write response.
7) Close connection or keep it open if required.

B) Client-Side--------------
1) Create a socket.
2) Connection it to a server socket.
3) Send request/write.
4) Read/Extract response.

# The_Main_Key_Of_Network_programming
TCP/IP network programming a powerful tool for creating a wide range of networked applications, from simple client-server interactions to complex distributed systems that operate across the globe.
